# Fractions and Negative Numbers
## Negative numbers
### Adding a positive number to a negative
How do you solve $-2 + 5 =$

For addition, you can always change the numbers. Consider: $5 - 2 = 3$

On the other hand: $-5 + 2$
### Subtracting a larger number
You can exchange the numbers. Consider $2 - 5$: 5 is bigger than 2, so you swap them to make $5-2=3$, then put a negative sign on it to $-3$. Overall: $2 - 5 = -3$.
### Adding a negative number
Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting.

Say the next case is $5 + (-2) = 5 - 2$.
### Subtracting two negatives
A negative of a negative makes a positive.

$5- (-2) = 5 + 2 = 7$
### Add two negative numbers
$-3 + -7 = -3 - 7 = -(3 + 7) = -10$
## Crash course on fractions
How do you add them? Multiplying is easier, adding is sometimes annoying.

$$\frac{5}{12} - \frac{11}{12}$$

Relatively straight forward, as they have the same denominator $12$. You can simply combine them, and at the top do the operation that was between the two fractions:

$$\frac{5-11}{12}$$

$$=-\frac{6}{12}$$

Find the biggest number that divides them both. The biggest number that divides them both is 6. So divide them both by 6.

$$=\frac{6 \div 6}{12 \div 6}$$

$$=-\frac{1}{2}$$

### Denominators are different - find LCM
Often, the denominator is different. You solve this by finding the lowest common multiple. For example,

$$\frac{1}{4} + \frac{5}{6} =$$

You can do this by writing the multiples of both:

4: 4, 8, **12**, 16, ...
6: 6, **12**, 18, 24, ...

The smallest multiple of both 4 and 6 is 12. The LCM is 12.

So you convert the denominators into 12 by multiplying the denominators so they reach 12, and multiplying the matching numerators by that same amount:

$$=\frac{1 \times 3}{4 \times 3} + \frac{5 \times 2}{6 \times 2}$$

$$=\frac{3}{12} + \frac{10}{12}$$

$$=\frac{13}{12}$$

### Alternative method to find a common multiple (not necessary the lowest)
If you don't want to find the LCM, you can just multiply the 2 numbers. For example, $4 \times 6 = 24$, instead of 12. Then do the same multiplication as above.

## Fractions within fractions
The $/$ is just a different notation for a fraction.

$$\left( -1 + \frac{1}{6} \right) / -5$$

$$\text{Top: }-1 + \frac{1}{6}$$

Remember,

$$\frac{n}{1} = n$$

**Conversely:**

$$n = \frac{n}{1}$$

Thus, $-1 = -\frac{1}{1}$

$$\text{Top: }-\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{6}$$

LCM is 6

$$\text{Top: }-\frac{1 \times 6}{1 \times 6} + \frac{1 \times 1}{6 \times 1}$$

$$\text{Top: }\frac{-6}{6} + \frac{1}{6}$$

$$\text{Top: }\frac{-6 + 1}{6}$$

$$\text{Top: }\frac{-5}{6}$$

$$\text{Bottom: } -5$$

There are 2 negative signs, a double negative. This is a fraction over a integer.

$$=\left( -\frac{5}{6} \right) / -5$$

$$=-\frac{5}{6} / -\frac{5}{1}$$

Get rid of negative signs.

$$=\frac{5}{6} / \frac{5}{1}$$

Then, use the formula:

$$\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}} = \frac{ad}{bc}$$

Memorize it by putting the outside products (multiplications) on the top, and the inside products on the bottom:

$$\frac{5 \cdot 1}{6 \cdot 5} = \frac{5}{30} = \frac{1}{6}$$

## Slash notation
Be careful. Remember it's the same as the horizontal line in a fraction.

$$\left( -1 + \frac{1}{6} \right) / -5 = \frac{\left( -1 + \frac{1}{6} \right)}{-5}$$

## Exercises

1)

$$\frac{-2}{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6}}$$

$$\text{Bottom: } \frac{3}{6} - \frac{1}{6}$$

$$\text{Bottom: } \frac{3 - 1}{6}$$

$$\text{Bottom: } \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$$

$$\text{Top: } -2 = -\frac{2}{1}$$

$$=-\frac{2}{1} \div \frac{1}{3}$$

The formula:

$$\frac{-2 \cdot 3}{1 \cdot 1}$$

$$=\frac{-6}{1} = -6$$

2)

$$\frac{\left( \frac{3}{4} - 2 \right)}{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{8}}$$

Top:

$$\frac{3}{4} - 2 = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{2}{1} = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{2 \times 4}{1 \times 4} = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{8}{4} = \frac{3-8}{4} = -\frac{5}{4}$$

Bottom:

$$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1 \times 4}{2 \times 4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{4}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{5}{8}$$

Both:

$$-\frac{5}{4} \div \frac{5}{8} = \frac{-5 \times 8}{4 \times 5} = -\frac{40}{20} = -\frac{2}{1} = -2$$
