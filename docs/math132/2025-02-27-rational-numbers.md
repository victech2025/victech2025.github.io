# Rational Numbers

## Notes
Assignment due 2 weeks on Friday

## Number sets
$\mathbb{N} = 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$
$\mathbb{Z} = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots$
$\mathbb{Q} = \text{rational numbers}$
	$= \text{fractions of integers}$
	$=\frac{2}{7}, -\frac{1}{5}$

These two are the same:
$$
-\frac{1}{5} = \frac{-1}{5}
$$
## Fractions
What are fractions? Say a circle = 1, if there were 3 parts, each slice would be $\frac{1}{3}$; the sum of all the parts would equal 1.
$$
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1
$$
You can use the language of definition. A fraction $\frac{b}{a}$ is a number such that if you add $\frac{b}{a} + \frac{b}{a} + \dots + \frac{b}{a}$ , $a$ times, it equals $b$.

$$
\frac{b}{a} + \frac{b}{a} + \dots + \frac{b}{a} = b
$$
### Properties of fractions
#### Property 1: If the numerator and the denominator are both divisible by the same **integer**, you can simplify the fraction.

Example (you can divide both by 5):
$\frac{15}{10}$
dividing both by 5 makes:
$\frac{3}{2}$
thus simplifying the fraction.

This is the simplest you can make this fraction. In other cases, there may be multiple simplifications. Example:
$\frac{8}{12}$
4 divides 8 and 12. 2 also divides.
**YOU SHOULD DIVIDE BY THE BIGGEST POSSIBLE NUMBER TO GET THE SIMPLEST FRACTION**
Dividing by 2 gets: $\frac{4}{6}$
Dividing by 4 gets: $\frac{2}{3}$
Thus, you should divide by 4, the larger number.
#### Property 2: For any integer $n$, $\frac{n}{1} = n$.
A fraction is the same thing as division. If you divide $n$ by 1, it's $n$. This implies another thing: every integer is a fraction. That's why all integers are rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$.

Example (both are divisible by 5):
$$
\frac{10}{5} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
$$
Therefore,
$$
\frac{10}{5} = 2
$$

Another example (top and bottom are both divisible by 4):
$$
\frac{-12}{4} = \frac{-3}{1} = -3
$$
#### Property 3. All fractions are also decimal numbers (possibly infinite)
The proof has to do with long division (which we will cover later).

Example:
$$
\frac{1}{2} = 0.5
$$
$$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$$
A decimal number that has the same property is:
$$0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0 = 1$$
$$
\frac{1}{3} = 0.333\dots
$$
$$
\frac{1}{5} = 0.2
$$
$$0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 1.0 = 1$$

$$
\frac{1}{6} = 0.16666\dots
$$
You can notice that in all cases it's either a finite decimal or an infinite series.
$$
\frac{1}{11} = 0.0909\dots
$$
The pattern could be 2 numbers repeating or just 1 digit repeating.

The reason $\frac{1}{3}$ divides into only one digit is because it divides into 9. The reason $\frac{1}{11}$ has two repeating numbers is because it divides into $99$.

$$\frac{1}{7} = 0.14285714\dots$$

It has a pattern of six numbers because $7$ divides by $999,999$, six nines.

In many areas decimals are very practical, whereas fractions are more theoretical.

$\mathbb{R}$: Real numbers
	$= \text{all decimal numbers}$

The real numbers are bigger and more vast than rational numbers.

Most decimal numbers are not rational numbers.
## Exercises
### Simplify fractions
E1, div by 2
$\frac{14}{8} = \frac{7}{4}$
Correct

E2, div by 2
$\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$
Correct

E3, div by 4
$\frac{12}{4} = \frac{3}{1} = 3$
Correct

E4, you can't simplify. It's a trick question.
$\frac{11}{4} = \frac{11}{4}$
