# Number Sets

## Topic 1 - Numbers
Numbers, number systems, integers, decimal numbers, imaginary numbers(?), operations. BEDMAS.

We will learn 4 number systems:
$$
\mathbb{N} \text{ - Natural numbers}
$$
$$
\mathbb{Z} \text{ - Integers}
$$
$$
\mathbb{Q} \text{ - Rational numbers}
$$
$$
\mathbb{R} \text{ - Real numbers}
$$

### Natural numbers (N)
0, 1, 2, 3, …

There is a debate whether 0 exists or not. For this course, assume it is.
### Integers (Z)
A superset of all natural numbers (N), plus their negatives.

$\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$

If the denominator divides the numerator without a remainder, then a fraction is an integer, which is the quotient of top divided by bottom.
* *E.g. in $\frac{8}{4}$, the quotient is $2$ (how many times the denominator fits into the numerator?), the remainder is 0.*(?)

In fact, $\frac{0}{1} = 0$. $\frac{1}{1} = 1$. $\frac{2}{1} = 2$, …

You can do the same for negative integers as well.

Hence, all integers are rational numbers.
### Rational numbers (Q)
Rational numbers are a superset of integers, including the fractions of integers.

E.g. $\frac{3}{2}$, $-\frac{5}{7}$, …

Not all decimals are rational numbers, such as Pi, which is irrational, as it cannot be written as a ratio/fraction (thus irrational), but decimal numbers that are rational and can be expressed as a fraction, such as 1.5 ($\frac{3}{2}$), are included.
### Real numbers (R)
Real numbers are decimal numbers. It is a superset of rational and irrational numbers.

$\frac{1}{2}$ = 0.5
$\frac{1}{3} = 0.333\dots$, but we like to write 0.3 with a dot on top of 3.
$\frac{1}{99} = 0.010101\dots$

In all those cases above, it's periodic. The same numbers repeat themselves. Not all decimal numbers have periodic patterns.

$0.1010010001\dots$ (there is a pattern, but it's not periodic; this is NOT a rational number).

All rational numbers are real numbers, but not all real numbers are rational numbers.
